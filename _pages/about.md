Hola reader! My name is Royal \[with-cheese\] Sequeira. I am a Research Scientist at LG Electronics Toronto AI Lab. I am a language enthusiast, an avid reader, and a mentor. In 2018, I founded [Sushiksha](https://sushiksha.konkanischolarship.com/), a mentoring program that mentors 150+ engineering and medical students in India.

In my free time I read books, meditate, pretend to exercise, and make fun of my friends.
